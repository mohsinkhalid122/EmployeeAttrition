Attrition is a problem that impacts all businesses and it leads to significant costs for a business, including the cost of business disruption, hiring new staff and training new staff. 

Therefore, businesses, in particular their HR departments have great interest in understanding the drivers of, and minimizing staff attrition. The use of classification models to predict if an employee is likely to quit could greatly increase HRâ€™s ability to intervene on time and remedy the situation to prevent attrition.
